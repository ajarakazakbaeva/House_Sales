# House_Sales
Coursera Data analysis with Python peer-graded Assignment: House Sales in King County, USA
In this assignment I analyzed and predicted housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors and so on. A template notebook was provided in the lab; my job was to complete the ten questions. I used IBM Watson Studio to perform the analysis.
